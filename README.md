Deep Evolution Networks 
=============

It is for my MSc final project

Abstract 

Deep learning is a popular big data analysis model in recent years. Especially in image processing and voice processing, it has shown significant performance. This project will reimplement a deep learning model, Deep Belief Networks and proof this modelâ€™s ability in image processing. After it, to study different kinds of structures impact in deep network, a new model called Deep Evolution Model is studied. This model uses a genetic algorithm to learn a mapping better layers network which may lose very little information by training multiple layers using a building up algorithm named evolution auto encoder. It is a flexible deep learning model and has a great potential in future.
